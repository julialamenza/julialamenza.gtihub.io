This practice aims to optimize cloud cost management by combining Finance and Operations to ensure resources are used efficiently and strategically. However, like any new concept, FinOps comes with its fair share of myths and misunderstandings. In this post, I’ll debunk some of the key myths surrounding FinOps and explain what truly lies behind this emerging discipline. Myth 1: FinOps is just about cutting costs Many people associate FinOps solely with cost-cutting, but the real goal is to optimize cloud investments. The focus isn’t necessarily on spending less, but on spending smarter, ensuring that every dollar invested in infrastructure brings maximum value to the business. This may involve adjusting resource usage, anticipating demand spikes, or even increasing spending to ensure performance and innovation. Myth 2: FinOps is only for large enterprises While large organizations are often seen as pioneers in FinOps, this practice is equally relevant for small and medium-sized businesses. Regardless of company size, any business using cloud services needs to manage its costs. For startups and SMBs, where every resource is limited, FinOps can make a critical difference by ensuring cloud spending doesn’t spiral out of control. If your company is just beginning its cloud journey, there’s no reason to delay FinOps adoption. Even in early stages, applying sound financial management practices in the cloud can help lay a strong foundation, ensuring that every technology investment is strategic and directly contributes to sustainable business growth. Myth 3: FinOps is solely the responsibility of the finance team FinOps is an interdisciplinary practice that requires collaboration across several teams—Finance, IT, Engineering, and Operations. A core principle of FinOps is shared visibility and accountability for costs. All departments need to work together to understand how cloud usage financially impacts the business and how those expenses can be optimized. If left solely to the finance team, there might be a lack of technical understanding regarding how resources are being utilized and what can actually be done to improve efficiency. Myth 4: FinOps is a one-time implementation FinOps is not a one-off project with a clear beginning, middle, and end, but rather an ongoing process. As cloud service usage evolves, new optimization opportunities arise. Technologies, tools, and best practices change rapidly, meaning that once implemented, FinOps needs to be continuously monitored and adjusted to keep pace with company growth and evolving needs. Myth 5: Automation solves all FinOps problems Automation is undeniably a crucial part of cloud financial management, but it doesn’t solve every problem on its own. There are tools that can help identify overages, forecast costs, and suggest optimizations. However, automation should be viewed as a facilitator, not a magic solution. For FinOps to be truly effective, human involvement is necessary—continuous analysis and an understanding of the business context are key to making informed, strategic decisions. Myth 6: FinOps is just about cost monitoring FinOps goes far beyond simply tracking how much is being spent in the cloud. It involves fostering a culture of financial responsibility, where everyone in the organization has visibility and clarity around how cloud resources are being used. This includes forecasting, budgeting, and even making strategic decisions about investments in new technologies or tools.

But what does this have to do with career? For a long time, I made the mistake of comparing myself to others. I work in a field full of people who inspire me and are extremely qualified, which often made me feel like I wasn’t good enough or that I was falling behind in my learning. I used to think that while everyone had already mastered a certain technology, I was still struggling to learn another one. That kind of comparison never brought me anything positive. On the contrary, it was through engaging more in communities and events that I realized a fundamental truth: everyone has their own time and journey. We shouldn’t compare ourselves to others, but to ourselves. It might sound like a cliché, but it’s a powerful truth. Each person follows a unique path, with their own skills and challenges. What works for one person may not work for you, and that’s okay. The most important thing is to respect your own journey and understand that even those you admire face challenges similar to yours. There’s nothing wrong with not knowing what the next step will be or with being curious about everything. The mistake is in trying to keep up with others, forgetting that you are unique. Respect your learning process, refine your methods, but never feel less worthy just because someone progressed faster in a certain area. That doesn’t diminish your value; it only means you might find ease in other areas. There will always be days when you feel insecure or lost, and others when everything makes sense. It’s normal to miss out on events or courses, just as it’s normal to have moments of higher engagement. And that’s okay too. Learning is a journey, and you must respect both that process and your mental health. Trying to take on everything at once is not always the best approach.
